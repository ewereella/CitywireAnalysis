Please find attached a subset of some publicly available flight data for various airlines in the US. The data is hosted on BigQuery; if you’d like to learn more about BigQuery’s public datasets you can do so here.

The exported CSV file contains one row per flight for three different airlines in the month of December 2022.

We’d like you to analyse the data and produce an interactive dashboard that determines the best performing airline, and provide some comments explaining your conclusions. You are free to interpret this requirement as you like.

You can use any software / reporting platform you like to analyse the data, and you can send it to us in any format you choose. Please also attach the report as a pdf in case there are any issues accessing it, and any code you have written if applicable.

You should spend no more than an hour on the task.
